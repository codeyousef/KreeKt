## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a web developer using KreeKt, I need a modern graphics renderer that leverages WebGPU's capabilities so that my 3D applications run with optimal performance in modern browsers, achieving smooth frame rates and supporting advanced rendering features.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a web application using KreeKt with WebGPU available in the browser, **When** the renderer initializes, **Then** it successfully creates a WebGPU rendering context and reports available capabilities

2. **Given** a 3D scene with meshes, materials, and lighting, **When** the renderer processes the scene, **Then** all objects are correctly rendered to the canvas with proper shading and transformations

3. **Given** a scene containing 1,000,000 triangles, **When** rendering at 1920x1080 resolution, **Then** the system maintains 60 frames per second

4. **Given** geometry data with vertices, normals, colors, and indices, **When** uploaded to the GPU, **Then** the data is efficiently stored and accessible for rendering without memory leaks

5. **Given** a shader program in WGSL format, **When** compiled by the renderer, **Then** the shader executes correctly and produces expected visual output

6. **Given** multiple meshes in a scene, **When** rendering a frame, **Then** all meshes are drawn in a single optimized render pass with minimal draw calls

7. **Given** a browser without WebGPU support, **When** attempting to initialize the renderer, **Then** it automatically falls back to WebGLRenderer and continues rendering without errors

8. **Given** an existing application using WebGLRenderer, **When** switching to WebGPU renderer, **Then** the visual output is identical (feature parity achieved)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GPU memory is exhausted during buffer allocation? System must implement automatic memory management to free unused resources and warn when approaching GPU memory limits.
- How does the system handle shader compilation errors in production?
- What occurs when the rendering canvas is resized during active rendering?
- How are GPU context loss events detected and recovered from? System must automatically detect context loss and recreate all GPU resources (buffers, textures, pipelines) to resume rendering.
- What happens when attempting to render geometry with invalid or missing attributes?
- How does the renderer behave when texture uploads exceed device limits?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect WebGPU availability in the browser environment and automatically fall back to WebGLRenderer when unavailable

- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize a WebGPU rendering context with configurable surface properties (resolution, color format, depth buffer, antialiasing)

- **FR-003**: System MUST render 3D scenes containing meshes, cameras, and lights with mathematically correct perspective projection and transformations

- **FR-004**: System MUST support uploading vertex data (positions, normals, colors, UV coordinates, indices) to GPU buffers efficiently

- **FR-005**: System MUST compile and execute shader programs with support for vertex and fragment stages

- **FR-006**: System MUST manage render pipeline state including depth testing, face culling, blending modes, and viewport configuration

- **FR-007**: System MUST handle texture creation, uploading, and sampling for material systems

- **FR-008**: System MUST provide identical visual output to the existing WebGLRenderer (feature parity requirement)

- **FR-009**: System MUST achieve 60 FPS at 1,000,000 triangles (1920x1080 resolution) on target hardware

- **FR-010**: System MUST properly dispose of GPU resources (buffers, textures, pipelines) to prevent memory leaks

- **FR-011**: System MUST detect GPU context loss events and automatically recover by recreating all GPU resources (buffers, textures, pipelines) to resume rendering

- **FR-012**: System MUST support rendering to the main canvas surface with configurable present modes (vsync, immediate, mailbox)

- **FR-013**: System MUST cache compiled shaders and pipeline states to avoid redundant GPU work across frames

- **FR-014**: System MUST provide error messages that clearly identify rendering failures and their causes

- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain compatibility with browsers supporting WebGPU 1.0 specification (Chrome 113+, Firefox 121+, Safari 18+), with automatic fallback to WebGLRenderer for older browsers

- **FR-016**: System MUST integrate with the existing KreeKt scene graph, camera system, and material system without API changes

- **FR-017**: System MUST track rendering statistics (draw calls, triangles rendered, GPU memory usage) for performance monitoring

- **FR-018**: System MUST support the same material types as WebGLRenderer (MeshBasicMaterial as minimum requirement)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Renderer initialization MUST complete within 2000ms on target hardware (constitutional backend budget)

- **NFR-002**: GPU memory usage SHOULD fully utilize available GPU memory while maintaining 60 FPS performance, with automatic memory management to prevent exhaustion

- **NFR-003**: Rendering performance MUST meet constitutional 60 FPS requirement with 1,000,000 triangles at 1920x1080 resolution

- **NFR-004**: Library size increase MUST stay within constitutional 5MB limit (gzipped)

### Key Entities

- **Render Pipeline**: Represents the complete rendering configuration including shader programs, vertex layouts, depth/stencil state, and rasterization settings

- **Shader Module**: Encapsulates compiled WGSL shader code for vertex and fragment processing stages

- **GPU Buffer**: Stores vertex data, index data, or uniform data in GPU-accessible memory with efficient upload mechanisms

- **Texture Resource**: Manages 2D/3D image data on GPU for material sampling and render targets

- **Render Pass**: Defines a single frame rendering operation including clear values, attachments, and draw commands

- **Pipeline Cache**: Stores previously compiled pipelines to avoid redundant shader compilation
