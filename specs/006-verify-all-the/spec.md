## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT constitutes complete implementation and WHY it matters
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to fix specific code issues (no tech implementation details)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders validating production readiness

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a project stakeholder, I need to verify that the KreeKt 3D graphics library implementation is production-ready with
all specified features fully implemented, so that the library can be confidently deployed to end users without
incomplete functionality or development placeholders.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the complete KreeKt codebase, **When** scanning all source files for implementation status, **Then** no
   development placeholders (TODO, FIXME, stub, placeholder, workaround, "for now", "in the meantime", "in a real
   implementation") should be found in production code paths
2. **Given** the feature specification document, **When** comparing against actual implementation, **Then** all
   specified components from all 13 phases should have functional implementations
3. **Given** the math library components, **When** testing core operations, **Then** all Vector2/3/4, Matrix3/4,
   Quaternion, and geometric primitives should be fully operational
4. **Given** the scene graph system, **When** creating complex hierarchies, **Then** Object3D, Scene, Camera, and
   transform systems should work without stubs
5. **Given** the material and shading system, **When** applying different materials, **Then** PBR materials, textures,
   and shader compilation should be complete
6. **Given** the rendering pipeline, **When** rendering complex scenes, **Then** WebGPU/Vulkan abstraction should be
   fully functional across platforms

### Edge Cases

- What happens when missing implementations are discovered in critical rendering paths?
- How does the system handle platform-specific features that may legitimately have stubs?
- What constitutes acceptable temporary implementations vs unacceptable placeholders?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST have zero TODO, FIXME, or placeholder comments in production code paths that affect core
  functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement all Phase 1 Foundation Layer components (math library, WebGPU/Vulkan abstraction,
  platform implementations) without stubs
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement all Phase 2 Scene Graph components (Object3D, cameras, geometry system) with
  complete functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement all Phase 3 Material & Shading components (shader management, material types,
  texture system) without workarounds
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement all critical components from Phases 4-9 (lighting, rendering, post-processing,
  animation, assets, controls) with functional implementations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide complete implementations for all geometric primitives specified (Box, Sphere, Plane,
  Cylinder, Cone, Torus, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide complete material implementations for all types specified (Basic, Lambert, Phong,
  Standard PBR, Physical PBR, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide complete texture support for all types specified (2D, 3D, Cube, Video, Canvas,
  Compressed, Data textures)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide complete lighting implementations for all types specified (Ambient, Directional,
  Point, Spot, Hemisphere, RectArea, LightProbe)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide complete rendering pipeline with functional WebGPU/Vulkan backends
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide complete camera control implementations (Orbit, Trackball, Fly, FirstPerson,
  PointerLock, Transform, Drag)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide complete animation system with functional skeletal animation, morph targets, and IK
  solving

### Implementation Quality Requirements

- **IQ-001**: All "for now" or "in the meantime" temporary solutions MUST be replaced with permanent implementations
- **IQ-002**: All "placeholder" or "stub" implementations MUST provide actual functionality or be marked as legitimately
  platform-specific
- **IQ-003**: All platform-specific expect/actual implementations MUST have functional implementations on supported
  platforms
- **IQ-004**: All critical rendering paths MUST be free of workarounds that compromise functionality
- **IQ-005**: All test implementations MUST use real functionality rather than mocked stubs for integration validation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Implementation Artifact**: Source code files, their completeness status, and quality metrics
- **Feature Component**: Individual features from the specification with their implementation state
- **Placeholder Pattern**: Code patterns indicating incomplete implementation (TODO, stub, workaround, etc.)
- **Quality Gate**: Criteria that must be met for production readiness verification
- **Platform Implementation**: Platform-specific code that may legitimately differ across targets

## Implementation Verification Results

### Critical Findings

**INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: The KreeKt library contains **157+ instances** of incomplete implementations,
placeholders, and temporary workarounds across all major subsystems.

### Summary of Implementation Gaps

#### Phase 1: Foundation Layer - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ **Math Library**: Vector2/3/4, Matrix3/4, Quaternion - **COMPLETE**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WebGPU/Vulkan Abstraction**: Has placeholder implementations in BufferManager, GPUStateManager
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Platform Implementations**: Multiple platform-specific stubs in XR, physics, and renderer systems

#### Phase 2: Scene Graph System - **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ **Core Objects**: Object3D, Scene, Group - **COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ **Camera System**: Perspective, Orthographic cameras - **COMPLETE**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Geometry System**: Has placeholder implementations in advanced geometries

#### Phase 3: Material & Shading System - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ **Basic Materials**: MeshStandardMaterial, MeshPhysicalMaterial - **COMPLETE**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Shader Management**: Contains placeholder shader compilation logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Texture System**: Has stub implementations in VideoTexture

#### Phases 4-13: Advanced Features - **HEAVILY INCOMPLETE**

- ‚ùå **Lighting System**: Multiple TODO items and placeholder implementations
- ‚ùå **Shadow System**: Incomplete shadow mapping with workarounds
- ‚ùå **Animation System**: Significant TODO items in skeletal animation
- ‚ùå **Physics Integration**: Extensive placeholder implementations
- ‚ùå **XR Support**: Mostly stub implementations across all platforms
- ‚ùå **Post-Processing**: Not implemented
- ‚ùå **Asset Pipeline**: Placeholder loader implementations

### Specific Problem Areas

**High-Priority Issues (Affecting Core Functionality):**

1. Renderer BufferManager has placeholder return statements
2. GPU state management has incomplete resource disposal
3. Shadow mapping system has extensive TODO implementations
4. Animation system has unimplemented fading and cross-fading
5. Physics world has simplified collision detection placeholders

**Medium-Priority Issues (Affecting Advanced Features):**

1. IBL processing has stub implementations
2. Texture atlas generation has placeholder algorithms
3. LOD system uses aggressive placeholder simplification
4. Character controller has simplified sweep test implementations

**Platform-Specific Stubs (May Be Acceptable):**

1. XR implementations marked as platform-specific stubs
2. AR system marked as not supported on certain platforms
3. Performance monitoring has platform-specific placeholders

### Production Readiness Assessment

**VERDICT: NOT PRODUCTION READY**

The library requires significant additional development to remove placeholders and complete implementations across:

- Advanced rendering features (shadows, post-processing)
- Animation system completion
- Physics engine integration completion
- XR/AR functionality implementation
- Asset loading pipeline completion

**Estimated Additional Development**: 8-12 weeks to complete all placeholder implementations and achieve production
readiness.
