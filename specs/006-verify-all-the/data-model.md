# Data Model: Complete Implementation Verification

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Context**: Data entities for tracking and managing implementation completion

## Core Entities

### ImplementationArtifact

**Purpose**: Represents a source code file and its implementation status

**Fields**:

- `filePath: String` - Absolute path to the source file

**Validation Rules**:

- `filePath` must exist and be readable
- `placeholderCount` must be non-negative
- `testCoverage` must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Constitutional compliance requires `placeholderCount == 0` for production paths

**Relationships**:

- Belongs to one `ModuleType`
- Contains multiple `PlaceholderPattern` instances
- May have associated `TestArtifact` instances

### PlaceholderPattern

**Purpose**: Represents a specific incomplete implementation found in code

**Fields**:

- `id: String` - Unique identifier
- `type: PlaceholderType` - Category of placeholder (TODO, Stub, Workaround, etc.)
- `location: CodeLocation` - File path, line number, column
- `content: String` - Actual placeholder text
- `context: String` - Surrounding code context
- `severity: Severity` - Impact level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- `estimatedEffort: Duration` - Expected time to implement
- `dependencies: List<String>` - Other artifacts this depends on

**Validation Rules**:

- `location` must reference valid file position
- `content` must not be empty
- `severity` must align with constitutional impact assessment
- `estimatedEffort` must be positive duration

**State Transitions**:

- `Identified` → `InProgress` → `Completed` → `Verified`

### ModuleType

**Purpose**: Categorizes implementation areas by functional domain

**Values**:

- `CORE_MATH` - Vector, Matrix, Quaternion operations
- `SCENE_GRAPH` - Object3D, Scene, Camera system
- `RENDERER` - BufferManager, GPUStateManager, RenderPass
- `MATERIAL` - Shader compilation, PBR materials
- `TEXTURE` - Texture loading, management, processing
- `LIGHTING` - Light types, shadows, IBL
- `ANIMATION` - Skeletal animation, IK, state machines
- `PHYSICS` - Collision detection, physics world
- `GEOMETRY` - Primitive generation, advanced geometries
- `CONTROLS` - Camera controls, input handling
- `XR_AR` - Virtual/Augmented reality support
- `OPTIMIZATION` - LOD, instancing, performance
- `PROFILING` - Performance monitoring, debugging

### PlaceholderType

**Purpose**: Categorizes types of incomplete implementations

**Values**:

- `TODO` - Explicit TODO comments
- `FIXME` - Known issues requiring fixes
- `STUB` - Placeholder method implementations
- `PLACEHOLDER` - Temporary data or logic
- `WORKAROUND` - Temporary solutions
- `FOR_NOW` - Explicitly temporary code
- `IN_THE_MEANTIME` - Interim solutions
- `REAL_IMPLEMENTATION` - References to future real implementations
- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` - Explicitly unimplemented features

### Priority

**Purpose**: Implementation priority based on impact and dependencies

**Values**:

- `CRITICAL` - Blocks core functionality, constitutional violation
- `HIGH` - Impacts major features, user-facing issues
- `MEDIUM` - Affects advanced features, optimization
- `LOW` - Minor improvements, platform-specific enhancements

### ImplementationStatus

**Purpose**: Current state of implementation artifact

**Values**:

- `INCOMPLETE` - Contains placeholders, not production-ready
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently being implemented
- `COMPLETE` - No placeholders, fully implemented
- `VERIFIED` - Complete and tested, constitutionally compliant

### QualityGate

**Purpose**: Represents criteria that must be met for production readiness

**Fields**:

- `name: String` - Gate identifier
- `description: String` - What this gate validates
- `criteria: List<QualityCriteria>` - Specific checks
- `required: Boolean` - Whether gate is mandatory
- `automatable: Boolean` - Whether gate can be automated
- `constitutionalRequirement: Boolean` - Whether mandated by constitution

**Validation Rules**:

- Constitutional requirement gates cannot be marked as optional
- Criteria must be measurable and testable

### TestArtifact

**Purpose**: Represents test coverage for implementation artifacts

**Fields**:

- `artifactPath: String` - Path to implementation being tested
- `testPath: String` - Path to test file
- `testType: TestType` - Category of test (Unit, Integration, Performance)
- `coverage: Float` - Percentage coverage
- `tddCompliant: Boolean` - Whether test was written before implementation
- `passRate: Float` - Percentage of tests passing

**Validation Rules**:

- Coverage must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Pass rate must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- TDD compliance required by constitution

### TestType

**Purpose**: Categories of tests for different validation levels

**Values**:

- `UNIT` - Individual function/class testing
- `INTEGRATION` - Module interaction testing
- `PLATFORM` - Platform-specific functionality
- `PERFORMANCE` - Speed and memory benchmarks
- `VISUAL` - Rendering output validation
- `CONTRACT` - API contract validation

## State Management

### Implementation Lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: Scan codebase to identify placeholders
2. **Classification**: Categorize by type, priority, and module
3. **Planning**: Create implementation tasks with dependencies
4. **Implementation**: Follow TDD cycle to replace placeholders
5. **Verification**: Validate constitutional compliance
6. **Integration**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Quality Gate Progression

- **Initial Scan**: Identify all placeholder patterns
- **Priority Assessment**: Categorize by constitutional impact
- **Implementation Planning**: Create dependency-ordered tasks
- **TDD Implementation**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Platform Validation**: Cross-platform testing
- **Performance Verification**: Maintain 60 FPS target
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Final verification

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability Requirements

- Support scanning 97+ source files efficiently
- Handle 157+ placeholder patterns without performance degradation
- Maintain real-time status tracking during implementation
- Support incremental compilation verification

### Memory Constraints

- Artifact metadata must fit within library size constraints
- Test execution must not exceed platform memory limits
- Incremental processing to avoid memory spikes during scanning

This data model provides the foundation for systematically tracking and managing the completion of all placeholder
implementations while ensuring constitutional compliance and production readiness.
