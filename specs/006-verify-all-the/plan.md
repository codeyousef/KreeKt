# Implementation Plan: Complete Implementation Verification

**Branch**: `006-verify-all-the` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-verify-all-the/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This implementation plan addresses the verification that all features in the KreeKt 3D graphics library specification
are fully implemented without stubs, TODOs, workarounds, or temporary placeholders. The verification identified 157+
instances of incomplete implementations across major subsystems. The plan focuses on completing these implementations to
achieve production readiness, with particular emphasis on advanced rendering features, animation systems, physics
integration, and XR/AR functionality that are currently incomplete.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Kotlin 1.9+ with Multiplatform plugin
**Primary Dependencies**: LWJGL 3.3.6, @webgpu/types 0.1.40, kotlinx-coroutines-core 1.8.0, kotlinx-serialization-json
1.6.0
**Storage**: N/A (3D graphics library, not data storage)
**Testing**: kotlin.test framework with platform-specific tests
**Target Platform**: JVM, JavaScript/WebGPU, Linux Native, Windows Native, iOS/macOS (disabled), Android
**Project Type**: multiplatform library - Kotlin Multiplatform structure
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS with 100k+ triangles, <100ms initialization time
**Constraints**: <5MB base library size, type-safe API with no runtime casts, constitutional TDD compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Complete 3D graphics library with 13 implementation phases, 97+ source files, production-ready
implementation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

✅ **COMPLIANT**: This verification and implementation plan enforces TDD by requiring tests to be written before
implementation code. All placeholder implementations identified must be replaced with proper TDD implementations
following Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

### II. Production-Ready Code Only

❌ **VIOLATION**: Current codebase contains 157+ instances of TODOs, stubs, placeholders, and temporary solutions. This
directly violates the constitutional requirement for 100% production-ready code.

### III. Cross-Platform Compatibility

✅ **COMPLIANT**: Implementation targets JVM, JavaScript, Linux Native, Windows Native, and Android platforms using
Kotlin Multiplatform expect/actual pattern.

### IV. Performance Standards

⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION**: Target 60 FPS with 100k+ triangles is specified, but current incomplete implementations may
impact performance. Must validate performance after completing implementations.

### V. Type Safety and API Design

✅ **COMPLIANT**: API follows Three.js compatibility patterns with Kotlin type safety. Uses sealed classes and maintains
type-safe design.

**GATE STATUS**: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS** - Constitutional violations identified and documented. Implementation plan
addresses all violations through systematic placeholder replacement following TDD methodology.

**Structure Decision**: Kotlin Multiplatform library structure is used with commonMain for shared code and
platform-specific source sets for JVM (Vulkan), JavaScript (WebGPU), and Native targets. The existing structure is
maintained but implementations must be completed to remove all placeholder code.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
    - For each dependency → best practices task
    - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: [what was chosen]
    - Rationale: [why chosen]
    - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
    - Entity name, fields, relationships
    - Validation rules from requirements
    - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
    - For each user action → endpoint
    - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
    - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
    - One test file per endpoint
    - Assert request/response schemas
    - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Each story → integration test scenario
    - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
      **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
    - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
    - Preserve manual additions between markers
    - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
    - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
    - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from verification findings and implementation priorities
- Each critical placeholder pattern → TDD implementation task with test-first approach
- Each module with placeholders → module completion task with dependency ordering
- Each constitutional violation → compliance restoration task
- Performance validation tasks for maintaining 60 FPS target

**Priority-Based Ordering Strategy**:

1. **Critical Path (Blocking Constitutional Violations)**:
    - Renderer BufferManager placeholder elimination [P]
    - GPUStateManager resource disposal completion [P]
    - Animation system fading/cross-fading implementation
    - Physics world collision detection implementation

2. **High Priority (Major Feature Impact)**:
    - Shadow mapping system completion
    - Skeletal animation IK solving
    - Lighting system IBL processing
    - Texture system video texture completion

3. **Medium Priority (Advanced Features)**:
    - Geometry system advanced primitives
    - Material system shader compilation
    - Optimization LOD system refinement
    - Profiling system platform implementations

4. **Low Priority (Platform-Specific Features)**:
    - XR/AR platform-specific implementations (where applicable)
    - Performance monitoring platform optimizations

**TDD Compliance Strategy**:

- Each implementation task preceded by failing test creation task
- Test tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Implementation tasks depend on corresponding test tasks
- Integration validation tasks after implementation groups

**Module Dependency Ordering**:

- Core math and scene graph (foundation) → Renderer system → Material/Texture systems → Lighting/Animation → Advanced
  features
- Platform-specific implementations after common implementations
- Performance validation after each major milestone

**Estimated Output**: 45-60 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:

- 15-20 test creation tasks [P]
- 25-35 implementation tasks (dependency-ordered)
- 5-10 integration validation tasks
- 5-10 performance verification tasks

**Constitutional Compliance Tracking**:

- Each task includes constitutional compliance validation
- Progress tracking toward zero placeholder implementations
- Performance benchmark maintenance requirements
- Cross-platform compilation verification

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation                                                          | Why Needed                                                                                     | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Production-Ready Code Only (157+ placeholders)                     | Large-scale library requires systematic completion of partial implementations across 13 phases | Complete rewrite would lose existing functional code and delay delivery by 12+ months                                |
| Performance Standards (unverified with incomplete implementations) | Cannot validate 60 FPS target until core rendering pipeline placeholders are completed         | Ignoring performance would violate constitutional requirements; partial implementation prevents accurate measurement |
