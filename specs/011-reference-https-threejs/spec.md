## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a 3D developer migrating from Three.js to KreeKt**, I need all the features I'm currently using in Three.js to be available in KreeKt, so that I can deploy my 3D applications to native platforms without rewriting my entire codebase or losing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Raycasting
1. **Given** a scene with 10,000 objects, **When** user clicks on screen, **Then** raycasting efficiently determines which objects intersect the click ray

### Edge Cases

- What happens when raycasting against an empty scene? → Returns empty intersection array
- How does the system handle audio when no AudioListener exists? → Audio sources render as mono without spatial effects
- What occurs when fog near > far values? → System should clamp or warn about invalid configuration
- How does CubeCamera perform on low-end mobile devices? → Should provide quality/performance options
- What happens when too many clipping planes are active? → System should enforce platform limits (WebGL2: 8 planes)
- How are InstancedMesh updates handled? → Efficient partial update API without full buffer uploads
- What occurs with video textures when video isn't loaded? → Placeholder texture until video ready
- How do morph targets work with skinned meshes? → Combined properly in shader, performance considerations documented

## Notes

### Migration Priority

Based on Three.js usage patterns, features should be implemented in this priority order:

**High Priority** (Most commonly used):
1. Raycasting - Critical for interaction
2. Fog - Common atmospheric effect
3. RenderTarget - Essential for post-processing
4. Helpers - Critical for development
5. Advanced Textures (Cube, Video, Canvas)

**Medium Priority**:
1. Curves & Paths - Used in many applications
2. Points & Sprites - Particle effects
3. Instancing - Performance optimization
4. Morph Targets - Animation
5. LOD - Performance optimization

**Lower Priority** (Specialized use cases):
1. Audio - Specific to interactive applications
2. Advanced Cameras - Specialized rendering
3. Clipping Planes - Architectural visualization
4. Shape & Path - 2D to 3D conversion
5. Enhanced Line Rendering - Specific rendering needs

### Implementation Considerations

This specification intentionally avoids implementation details, but the planning phase should consider:
- Platform differences (WebGPU vs Vulkan capabilities)
- Performance targets (60 FPS maintained)
- Memory constraints (<5MB base library)
- API consistency with existing KreeKt modules
- Migration path for Three.js developers

### Success Metrics

Feature parity will be measured by:
1. **API Coverage**: 95%+ of Three.js documented APIs available
2. **Functional Equivalence**: Three.js examples run on KreeKt with minimal changes
3. **Performance**: Matching or exceeding Three.js performance benchmarks
4. **Developer Experience**: Migration guides and examples for all major features
