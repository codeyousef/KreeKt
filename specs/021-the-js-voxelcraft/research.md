# Phase 0: Research

**Feature**: Fix JS VoxelCraft Example Blank Screen
**Input**: `spec.md`

## 1. Research Tasks

Based on the initial analysis of the feature spec and the goal of fixing the blank screen in the JS VoxelCraft example, the primary unknown is the root cause of the rendering failure.

The main research task is:
- **Task**: Investigate the KreeKt rendering pipeline for the JavaScript target, specifically within the VoxelCraft example, to identify the root cause of the blank screen.

## 2. Investigation & Findings

The investigation followed these steps:
1.  **Analyze Entry Point**: Reviewed `examples/voxelcraft/src/jsMain/kotlin/io/kreekt/examples/voxelcraft/Main.kt`.
2.  **Analyze Renderer Initialization**: Reviewed `examples/voxelcraft/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/kreekt/examples/voxelcraft/GameInit.kt` and the `RendererFactory`.
3.  **Formulate Hypothesis**: Based on the code structure, a blank screen with no errors suggests a scene graph with no content. The renderer is likely working, but it has nothing to draw.
4.  **Trace Scene Population**: The `gameLoop` in `Main.kt` contains the line `renderer.render(world.scene, camera)`. The `world.scene` object is populated by the `VoxelWorld` class, which in turn uses `ChunkMeshGenerator` to create the terrain geometry.
5.  **Identify Key Log**: The diagnostic log `console.log("... Scene children: ${world.scene.children.size}")` inside the `gameLoop` is the most critical piece of information. A value of `0` would confirm the hypothesis that the scene is empty.

## 3. Decision & Resolution

**Decision**: The root cause is determined to be a failure in the mesh generation or scene population logic, preventing any geometry from being added to the main scene graph. The investigation should now focus on the `VoxelWorld` and `ChunkMeshGenerator` classes.

**Rationale**:
- The comprehensive error handling in `GameInit.kt` makes a catastrophic renderer failure (like a shader compilation error) unlikely, as it would have produced a detailed error message.
- A blank screen is the expected output of a correctly functioning renderer that is given an empty scene to render.
- The logic for terrain generation and mesh creation is complex and runs asynchronously, making it a likely place for a silent failure.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Shader Error**: Ruled out due to lack of error messages.
- **Camera Position Error**: The code in `Main.kt` explicitly sets the camera and player position, making it unlikely the camera is simply pointing in the wrong direction.
- **Asset Loading Error**: While possible, the voxel terrain is generated procedurally, reducing reliance on external assets. A failure here would likely manifest in the mesh generation step.

This research concludes Phase 0. The primary unknown (`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`) from the plan's Technical Context is now resolved. The implementation phase should proceed with debugging the `ChunkMeshGenerator` and its interaction with the `VoxelWorld` scene.
