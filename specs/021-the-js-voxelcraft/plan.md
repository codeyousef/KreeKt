# Implementation Plan: Fix JS VoxelCraft Example Blank Screen

**Branch**: `021-the-js-voxelcraft` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/021-the-js-voxelcraft/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan addresses a critical bug in the VoxelCraft JS example where the application shows a blank screen. Research indicates the issue likely lies in the scene graph population, where generated terrain meshes are not being added to the scene. The technical approach is to debug the `ChunkMeshGenerator` and `VoxelWorld` classes to ensure geometry is correctly generated and attached to the scene graph for rendering.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Kotlin 1.9
**Primary Dependencies**: KreeKt (self), Gradle, WebGPU/WebGL
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: JUnit, Spek
**Target Platform**: Web (WASM) via Kotlin/JS
**Project Type**: Multiplatform Library with Examples
**Performance Goals**: Runtime performance target (FPS) is not strictly defined, but interaction should be smooth.
**Constraints**: Must work in modern browsers supporting WebGPU.
**Scale/Scope**: This fix is scoped to the `voxelcraft` example.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- No violations of the project constitution are anticipated. The work involves debugging and fixing existing code within the established architecture.

```

**Structure Decision**: The project structure is already established as a Kotlin Multiplatform project. The changes will be confined to the `jsMain` sources within the KreeKt library and the `examples/voxelcraft` module.

## Complexity Tracking

Not applicable, as no constitutional violations are required.
