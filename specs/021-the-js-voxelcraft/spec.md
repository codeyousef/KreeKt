# Feature Specification: Fix JS VoxelCraft Example Blank Screen

**Feature Branch**: `021-the-js-voxelcraft`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the js voxelcraft example shows a black blank screen. do a comprehensive scan of the codebase until you are 100% certain you found the issue. check @log.md and follow tdd"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: Regarding the error message for unsupported browsers (FR-005), what level of detail should it provide? → A: C
- Q: Success criterion SC-002 states the JS example should be "functionally identical" to the JVM version. How strictly should this be interpreted? → A: C

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View VoxelCraft Example on Web (Priority: P1)

As a developer or potential user of KreeKt, when I run the JavaScript VoxelCraft example, I want to see the fully rendered 3D voxel scene so that I can evaluate the library's capabilities on the web platform.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for demonstrating the library's cross-platform capabilities, which is a core value proposition of KreeKt. A broken primary example undermines trust and prevents evaluation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by compiling and running the `voxelcraft` example for the JS target and verifying that the 3D scene renders and is interactive in a web browser.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has built the KreeKt project for the JavaScript target, **When** they open the `voxelcraft` example in a supported web browser, **Then** a 3D voxel world is displayed.
2. **Given** the `voxelcraft` example is running in the browser, **When** the user attempts to move the camera using the standard controls, **Then** the camera's viewpoint updates in response to the input.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the browser does not support the required graphics API (WebGPU/WebGL2)? The application must detect this and display a detailed error message specifying the missing technology and linking to a list of supported browsers.
- How does the system handle slow network connections when loading 3D assets? The application should display a loading indicator while assets are being fetched and downloaded.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The VoxelCraft example, when compiled for and run on the JavaScript target, MUST render the complete 3D voxel scene.
- **FR-002**: The initial view of the example MUST NOT be a blank, black, or otherwise empty screen.
- **FR-003**: All expected 3D models, textures, and assets for the VoxelCraft scene MUST be loaded and displayed correctly.
- **FR-004**: The example MUST be interactive, allowing the user to control the camera or interact with the scene as intended.
- **FR-005**: If the user's browser is unsupported, the system MUST display a detailed message specifying the missing technology (e.g., "Your browser does not support WebGPU or WebGL2, which are required to run this example.") and provide a link to a documentation page listing supported browsers.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of users running the JS VoxelCraft example on a supported browser are presented with an interactive 3D scene instead of a blank screen.
- **SC-002**: All major features and interactions in the JS example must be the same as the JVM version (the visual benchmark), but minor visual differences (e.g., anti-aliasing, lighting) are acceptable.
- **SC-003**: The example application loads and becomes interactive within 5 seconds on a standard developer machine using a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Assumptions

- A correct, working version of the VoxelCraft example exists on another platform (e.g., JVM) that can be used as a reference for correct behavior and appearance.
- The issue is a bug within the JS rendering pipeline or asset loading process, not a fundamental flaw in the example's logic.
