# Feature Specification: Production Readiness Confirmation

**Feature Branch**: `009-confirm-the-entire`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "confirm the entire codebase is production ready"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: "confirm entire codebase is production ready"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: production readiness, entire codebase, confirmation process
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define validation scenarios for production readiness
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Production metrics, validation reports, readiness scores
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Check for completeness and clarity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: What should be the minimum test coverage percentage required for production readiness? ‚Üí A: 95% code coverage
- Q: Which platforms must the code compile successfully for production readiness? ‚Üí A: All Kotlin Multiplatform targets
- Q: What is the minimum frames per second (FPS) requirement for 3D rendering performance validation? ‚Üí A: 120 FPS
  minimum
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable size for the base library build artifact? ‚Üí A: 2 MB maximum
- Q: What must be included for documentation to be considered complete for production readiness? ‚Üí A: none for now

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a project stakeholder, I need to confirm that the entire KreeKt codebase meets production standards, so that I can
confidently release the library to production environments with assurance of quality, performance, and stability.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a complete codebase audit is requested, **When** the production readiness check is executed, **Then** a
   comprehensive report is generated showing all production criteria and their pass/fail status

2. **Given** production readiness criteria exist, **When** the validation runs, **Then** each criterion is evaluated
   with measurable metrics and a clear pass/fail result

3. **Given** the codebase contains multiple modules, **When** validation is performed, **Then** each module is
   independently assessed and an overall readiness score is calculated

4. **Given** validation issues are found, **When** the report is generated, **Then** specific remediation actions are
   provided for each failing criterion

### Edge Cases

- What happens when new code is added during validation?
- How does the system handle partial module failures?
- What occurs if performance benchmarks cannot be executed?
- How are third-party dependencies validated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate that all code compiles successfully across all Kotlin Multiplatform targets (JVM,
  JavaScript, Native Linux/Windows/Mac, Android, iOS, watchOS, tvOS)

- **FR-002**: System MUST confirm test coverage meets minimum threshold of 95% code coverage

- **FR-003**: System MUST verify performance benchmarks meet requirements of minimum 120 FPS for 3D rendering, memory
  usage within platform limits, and initialization time under 2 seconds

- **FR-004**: System MUST check for security vulnerabilities in code and
  dependencies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which security standards - OWASP, CVE database?]

- **FR-005**: Documentation validation is not required for initial production readiness (deferred to future phase)

- **FR-006**: System MUST confirm no placeholder code remains (TODO, FIXME, stub implementations)

- **FR-007**: System MUST verify all constitutional requirements are
  met [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what are the specific constitutional requirements?]

- **FR-008**: System MUST validate cross-platform
  consistency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what aspects must be consistent - API, behavior, performance?]

- **FR-009**: System MUST generate a production readiness score with detailed breakdown

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide actionable remediation steps for any failures

- **FR-011**: System MUST validate all examples and demos function correctly

- **FR-012**: System MUST confirm build artifacts meet size constraints of maximum 2 MB for base library across all
  platforms

### Key Entities

- **Production Readiness Report**: Overall assessment containing readiness score, criteria evaluations, and remediation
  actions
- **Validation Criterion**: Individual check with name, description, pass/fail status, metrics, and importance level
- **Module Assessment**: Per-module evaluation with specific scores and issues
- **Remediation Action**: Specific step required to address a validation failure with priority and estimated effort

## Notes

The specification has been clarified through stakeholder input on key validation criteria:

- Test coverage requirement: 95% minimum
- Platform support: All Kotlin Multiplatform targets
- Performance target: 120 FPS minimum for 3D rendering
- Size constraint: 2 MB maximum for base library
- Documentation: Not required for initial production readiness

Remaining clarifications needed:

- Security validation standards (OWASP, CVE database specifics)
- Constitutional requirements details
- Cross-platform consistency aspects
