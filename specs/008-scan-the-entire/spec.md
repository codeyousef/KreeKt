# Feature Specification: Production Readiness Audit & JavaScript Renderer Fix

**Feature Branch**: `008-scan-the-entire`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "scan the entire project for placeholder, stubs, todos, 'in the meantime', 'for now', 'in a
real implementation' etc. make sure everything is implemented and 100% production ready and ./gradlew :examples:
basic-scene:dev still shows a black screen with an overlay"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: comprehensive production readiness audit + JavaScript rendering fix
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, production systems, end users
   ‚Üí Actions: scan, audit, fix, validate, ensure production readiness
   ‚Üí Data: source code, placeholders, stub implementations, example outputs
   ‚Üí Constraints: 100% production ready, working JavaScript example
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Production readiness criteria defined
   ‚Üí Placeholder detection patterns specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear validation scenarios for production readiness
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Codebase components, placeholders, implementations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are implementation-ready
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer deploying KreeKt to production, I need confidence that all code is production-ready with no placeholders,
stubs, or temporary implementations, and that all examples work correctly to demonstrate the library's capabilities to
end users.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the KreeKt codebase, **When** scanning for placeholder patterns, **Then** no instances of "TODO", "
   FIXME", "placeholder", "stub", "in the meantime", "for now", "in a real implementation", or similar temporary markers
   are found
2. **Given** the JavaScript example application, **When** running `./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:dev`, **Then** a
   functional 3D scene renders correctly in the browser instead of a black screen
3. **Given** any module in the codebase, **When** examining implementations, **Then** all expect/actual declarations
   have concrete implementations
4. **Given** all test suites, **When** executing tests, **Then** 100% pass rate is maintained with meaningful test
   coverage
5. **Given** production deployment requirements, **When** validating the codebase, **Then** all critical paths have
   robust error handling and no mock/stub dependencies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when platform-specific implementations are missing?
- How does the system handle incomplete renderer implementations?
- What occurs when examples fail to initialize due to missing dependencies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and catalog all placeholder text patterns ("TODO", "FIXME", "placeholder", "stub", "
  in the meantime", "for now", "in a real implementation") across the entire codebase
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace all identified placeholders with complete, production-ready implementations
- **FR-003**: JavaScript example renderer MUST display functional 3D graphics instead of a black screen when accessed
  via browser
- **FR-004**: All expect/actual declarations MUST have concrete platform-specific implementations with no stub fallbacks
- **FR-005**: All example applications MUST demonstrate working functionality across all supported platforms (JVM,
  JavaScript, Native)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain 100% test success rate after all placeholder replacements
- **FR-007**: All renderer implementations MUST provide functional graphics output appropriate to their platform
- **FR-008**: Error handling MUST be robust and production-appropriate with no debug-only or temporary error states
- **FR-009**: All dependencies MUST be production-grade with no development-only or mock implementations
- **FR-010**: Documentation and examples MUST accurately reflect the actual implemented functionality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Placeholder Instance**: Location, type, pattern, replacement requirement, criticality level
- **Implementation Gap**: Module, expected functionality, current state, completion requirements
- **Renderer Component**: Platform target, rendering capability, current implementation status, required features
- **Example Application**: Platform, functionality demonstrated, current state, expected behavior
- **Test Coverage**: Module, test type, current status, coverage gaps
