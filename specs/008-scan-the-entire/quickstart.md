# Quickstart: Production Readiness Validation

**Feature**: Production Readiness Audit & JavaScript Renderer Fix
**Date**: 2025-09-28

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides step-by-step instructions for validating the production readiness of the KreeKt 3D
graphics library after implementing the comprehensive audit system.

## Prerequisites

- KreeKt project cloned locally
- Kotlin 2.2.20+ installed
- Gradle 8.14.3+ available
- Supported browsers for JavaScript testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- JVM 17+ for desktop testing

## Quick Validation (5 minutes)

### 1. Run Complete Validation Suite

```bash
# Navigate to KreeKt project root
cd /path/to/KreeKt

# Execute comprehensive production readiness check
./gradlew validateProductionReadiness

# Expected output:
# ✅ Placeholder scan: 0 placeholders found
# ✅ Implementation gaps: 0 gaps detected
# ✅ Renderer validation: All platforms functional
# ✅ Test suite: 627/627 tests passing (100%)
# ✅ Example validation: All examples functional
# ✅ Performance: All benchmarks within targets
#
# 🎉 Production readiness: PASS
```

### 2. Verify JavaScript Example

```bash
# Start JavaScript example
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:8080
# Expected: Functional 3D scene with rotating cubes, not black screen
```

### 3. Verify JVM Example

```bash
# Run JVM example
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:runJvm

# Expected: LWJGL window opens with interactive 3D scene
```

## Detailed Validation (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Placeholder Detection

```bash
# Run placeholder scan only
./gradlew scanPlaceholders

# Review scan results
cat build/reports/placeholders/scan-result.json

# Expected: Empty results or specific items to address
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- Zero instances of "TODO", "FIXME", "placeholder", "stub"
- Zero instances of "in the meantime", "for now", "in a real implementation"
- All detected items have been replaced with production code

### Step 2: Implementation Gap Analysis

```bash
# Run implementation gap analysis
./gradlew analyzeImplementationGaps

# Review gap analysis
cat build/reports/gaps/gap-analysis.json

# Check specific platform coverage
./gradlew validatePlatformImplementations
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- All expect declarations have corresponding actual implementations
- All platforms (JVM, JS, Native) have complete implementations
- No stub or mock implementations in production paths

### Step 3: Renderer Validation

```bash
# Validate all renderer implementations
./gradlew validateRenderers

# Test JavaScript renderer specifically
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:jsTest

# Test JVM renderer specifically
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:jvmTest
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- JavaScript renderer displays functional 3D graphics
- JVM renderer creates LWJGL window with interactive scene
- All renderer tests pass across platforms
- Performance meets 60 FPS target with test scenes

### Step 4: Test Suite Validation

```bash
# Run complete test suite
./gradlew test allTests

# Generate test coverage report
./gradlew koverGenerateReport

# Review test results
open build/reports/tests/allTests/index.html
open build/reports/kover/html/index.html
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- 100% test success rate (627/627 tests passing)
- Minimum 90% line coverage maintained
- All platforms execute tests successfully
- No skipped or ignored tests in production validation

### Step 5: Example Application Testing

```bash
# Test all example applications
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:runJvm &
JVM_PID=$!

./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:dev &
JS_PID=$!

# Manual validation:
# 1. JVM window opens with 3D scene
# 2. WASD/QE controls work for camera movement
# 3. Mouse drag rotates camera view
# 4. JavaScript browser shows same 3D scene
# 5. Both maintain smooth 60 FPS rendering

# Cleanup background processes
kill $JVM_PID $JS_PID
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- Both examples render functional 3D scenes
- Interactive controls work correctly
- Performance targets achieved
- Cross-platform visual consistency

### Step 6: Performance Benchmarking

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
./gradlew benchmarkPerformance

# Review performance reports
cat build/reports/performance/benchmark-results.json
```

**Validation Criteria**:

- 60 FPS achieved with target scene complexity
- Memory usage within constitutional limits
- Initialization time under 2 seconds
- No performance regressions from baseline

## Expected Results

## Troubleshooting

### JavaScript Example Shows Black Screen

```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Open DevTools → Console

# Common fixes:
# 1. Clear browser cache
# 2. Check WebGL support: visit https://get.webgl.org/
# 3. Update browser to latest version
# 4. Try different browser
```

### JVM Example Fails to Start

```bash
# Check Java version
java -version

# Verify LWJGL natives
./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:dependencies

# Common fixes:
# 1. Update to JVM 17+
# 2. Check graphics drivers
# 3. Verify LWJGL platform natives
```

### Test Failures

```bash
# Run specific failing test
./gradlew test --tests "SpecificTestClass"

# Check for platform-specific issues
./gradlew jvmTest
./gradlew jsTest
./gradlew linuxX64Test
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Profile memory usage
./gradlew profileMemory

# Check for resource leaks
./gradlew validateResourceCleanup

# Analyze frame timing
./gradlew analyzeFrameTiming
```

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Zero placeholder patterns detected in codebase
- [ ] All expect/actual declarations have complete implementations
- [ ] JavaScript example renders functional 3D scene (not black screen)
- [ ] JVM example opens interactive LWJGL window
- [ ] All 627 tests pass across all platforms
- [ ] Test coverage maintains >90% line coverage

## Next Steps

After successful validation:

1. **Deploy to production** - All systems are production-ready
2. **Update documentation** - Reflect current implementation status
3. **Performance monitoring** - Set up continuous performance tracking
4. **Regression prevention** - Ensure CI/CD prevents future placeholders
