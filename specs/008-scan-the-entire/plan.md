**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-scan-the-entire/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✓
   → Feature spec loaded: Production readiness audit + JavaScript renderer fix
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) ✓
   → Project Type: Kotlin Multiplatform 3D Graphics Library
   → Structure Decision: Multiplatform library with examples
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document ✓
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below ✓
   → No violations detected - audit ensures constitutional compliance
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✓
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✓
   → All technical details are known from codebase analysis
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✓
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No new violations - design maintains constitutional compliance

- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Comprehensive production readiness audit to eliminate all placeholder patterns ("TODO", "FIXME", "
stub", "placeholder", "in the meantime", "for now", "in a real implementation") and replace with complete
implementations, plus fix JavaScript example renderer to display functional 3D graphics instead of black screen.

Technical approach: Systematic codebase scanning using pattern matching, implementation gap analysis, renderer
completion for JavaScript platform, and validation through working examples and test execution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Kotlin 2.2.20, JavaScript ES2020, JVM 17+
**Primary Dependencies**: Kotlin Multiplatform, LWJGL 3.3.3, WebGL/WebGPU, kotlinx-coroutines-core
**Storage**: File system (source code scanning), memory (runtime state)
**Testing**: Kotlin Test multiplatform framework, platform-specific testing
**Target Platform**: JVM, JavaScript (Browser), Linux Native, Windows Native (MinGW), macOS Native
**Project Type**: Multiplatform library - Cross-platform 3D graphics library with examples
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS rendering, fast compilation, efficient scanning
**Constraints**: 100% production ready code, working JavaScript example, cross-platform compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: ~150 source files, 627 tests, 4 platform targets, 2 example applications

**Structure Decision**: Existing multiplatform library structure is maintained. Audit will scan all source directories
for placeholder patterns and ensure complete implementations across all platform targets.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Complete**: All technical context is known from existing codebase analysis.

### Key Findings:

1. **Placeholder Patterns Identified**:
    - Pattern list: "TODO", "FIXME", "placeholder", "stub", "in the meantime", "for now", "in a real implementation"
    - Search patterns include comments, string literals, and documentation
    - Must scan all source files (.kt, .md, .gradle.kts)

2. **JavaScript Renderer Issue**:
    - Current WebGPU renderer shows black screen due to incomplete implementation
    - Requires proper WebGL shader pipeline, vertex buffers, and rendering loop
    - Must integrate with existing KreeKt scene graph

3. **Implementation Gap Analysis**:
    - expect/actual declarations need concrete platform implementations
    - Mock/stub renderers need functional implementations
    - Example applications need working demonstrations

4. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Maintain 100% test success rate (627 tests)
    - Add validation for production readiness
    - Platform-specific testing for renderer fixes

**Output**: research.md with comprehensive analysis

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Design Artifacts Generated:

1. **Data Model** (`data-model.md`):
    - PlaceholderInstance entity (location, type, pattern, criticality)
    - ImplementationGap entity (module, functionality, status)
    - RendererComponent entity (platform, capabilities, status)
    - ValidationResult entity (status, metrics, recommendations)

2. **API Contracts** (`/contracts/`):
    - PlaceholderScanner interface for pattern detection
    - ImplementationValidator interface for gap analysis
    - RendererFactory interface for platform-specific renderers
    - ProductionReadinessChecker interface for overall validation

3. **Contract Tests**:
    - Placeholder detection accuracy tests
    - Implementation completeness tests
    - Renderer functionality tests
    - Cross-platform compatibility tests

4. **Quickstart Guide** (`quickstart.md`):
    - Step-by-step production readiness validation
    - Example application testing procedures
    - Performance verification steps

5. **Agent Context** (`CLAUDE.md`):
    - Updated with production readiness audit context
    - JavaScript renderer fix requirements
    - Constitutional compliance validation

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. **Scanning Tasks**:
    - Comprehensive codebase scan for placeholder patterns
    - Platform-specific implementation gap analysis
    - Documentation and comment analysis

2. **Implementation Tasks**:
    - Replace identified placeholders with production code
    - Complete JavaScript WebGL renderer implementation
    - Fix expect/actual implementation gaps
    - Enhance example applications

3. **Validation Tasks**:
    - Test suite execution and validation
    - Example application functionality testing
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Cross-platform compatibility verification

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Scanning and analysis tasks first (gather data)
- Implementation tasks by dependency order (core → platform → examples)
- Testing and validation tasks last (verify completion)
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitutional violations detected - all requirements align with constitutional principles*

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
