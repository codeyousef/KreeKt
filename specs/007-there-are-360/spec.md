# Feature Specification: Fix Critical Compilation Errors

**Feature Branch**: `007-there-are-360`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "there are 360 errors in compilemainkotlinmetadata,28 errors in compilekotlinlinuxx64, and
27 errors in compilekotlinmingwx64 use the available agents to fix them all"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Multi-platform compilation failure with critical error counts
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, CI/CD systems, build tools
   ‚Üí Actions: Compilation, error resolution, build verification
   ‚Üí Data: Source code, compilation outputs, error logs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Cross-platform compatibility, zero compilation errors
3. Identify compilation error categories
   ‚Üí Type resolution errors, import issues, missing dependencies
   ‚Üí Platform-specific compatibility issues
   ‚Üí API mismatches between platforms
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow for fixing compilation issues
   ‚Üí Automated build verification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Error detection, categorization, and resolution
   ‚Üí Cross-platform compilation success
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Compilation errors, source files, platform targets
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All critical compilation errors must be resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be fixed and WHY it's critical
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement specific fixes (no code changes, APIs)
- üë• Written for development team leads and release managers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the KreeKt 3D graphics library, I need all compilation errors resolved across all target
platforms so that the library can be built, tested, and deployed successfully for production use.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a KreeKt codebase with 360 metadata compilation errors, **When** compilation is attempted, **Then** the
   build must complete successfully with zero errors
2. **Given** a KreeKt codebase with 28 Linux x64 compilation errors, **When** native Linux compilation is run, **Then**
   all platform-specific code must compile without errors
3. **Given** a KreeKt codebase with 27 MinGW x64 compilation errors, **When** Windows native compilation is run, **Then
   ** all Windows-specific code must compile successfully
4. **Given** all compilation errors are fixed, **When** CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** all target platforms must build
   and pass tests
5. **Given** the library compiles successfully, **When** developers integrate it into projects, **Then** they must be
   able to use all library features without compilation issues

### Edge Cases

- What happens when fixing one platform breaks compilation on another platform?
- How does the system handle dependency conflicts between platforms?
- What if compilation errors reveal missing implementations in cross-platform abstractions?
- How are circular dependencies resolved during the fix process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST resolve all 360 compilation errors in the Kotlin metadata compilation target
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve all 28 compilation errors in the Linux x64 native compilation target
- **FR-003**: System MUST resolve all 27 compilation errors in the MinGW x64 (Windows) native compilation target
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain cross-platform compatibility while fixing platform-specific errors
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing functionality and API contracts during error resolution
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify that fixes don't introduce new compilation errors on other platforms
- **FR-007**: System MUST categorize errors by type (missing imports, type mismatches, API incompatibilities)
- **FR-008**: System MUST prioritize critical path errors that block basic library functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all expect/actual declarations are properly matched across platforms
- **FR-010**: System MUST resolve dependency version conflicts and missing platform-specific implementations
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that the entire multiplatform project compiles successfully
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain build performance and compilation speed during fixes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Compilation Error**: Specific build failure with error message, file location, platform target, and error category
- **Platform Target**: Specific compilation target (metadata, Linux x64, MinGW x64) with platform-specific requirements
- **Source File**: Kotlin source code file that may contain compilation errors requiring fixes
- **Dependency**: External library or internal module dependency that may cause version conflicts or missing
  implementations
- **Expect/Actual Declaration**: Cross-platform abstraction pair that must be properly implemented for each target
  platform
