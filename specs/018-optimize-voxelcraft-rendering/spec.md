# Feature Specification: Optimize VoxelCraft Rendering with WebGPU/Vulkan GPU Acceleration

**Feature Branch**: `018-optimize-voxelcraft-rendering`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "you are not fixing the issue of the very slow rendering at 0 fps. make sure the gpu is fully utilized via webgpu/vulkan"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: 0 FPS rendering issue due to lack of WebGPU implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: VoxelCraft game, WebGPU/Vulkan renderer, GPU hardware
   ‚Üí Actions: Utilize GPU, render 60 FPS, implement WebGPU
   ‚Üí Data: 81 chunks, ~160K triangles, vertex buffers, index buffers
   ‚Üí Constraints: 30 FPS minimum (constitutional), 60 FPS target
3. Unclear aspects: None - requirement is clear
4. User scenarios defined below
5. Functional requirements generated
6. Key entities identified
7. Review checklist: In progress
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player launches VoxelCraft in a modern web browser with WebGPU support. The game initializes, generates terrain, and renders at 60 FPS with smooth camera movement and responsive controls. The GPU is fully utilized to render 81 chunks with ~160K triangles without frame drops. On browsers without WebGPU, the game gracefully falls back to optimized WebGL rendering at 30+ FPS.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a modern browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+), **When** VoxelCraft loads and generates terrain, **Then** the game renders at 60 FPS with GPU utilization metrics showing efficient draw calls and buffer usage

2. **Given** 81 chunks are visible with ~3000-5000 vertices each (~160K total triangles), **When** the player moves and rotates the camera, **Then** frame rate remains at 60 FPS without stuttering or dropped frames

3. **Given** a browser without WebGPU support (Firefox, Safari), **When** VoxelCraft loads, **Then** the game detects lack of WebGPU, falls back to optimized WebGL, and renders at 30+ FPS

4. **Given** terrain generation is in progress (meshes being generated asynchronously), **When** new chunk meshes are added to the scene, **Then** rendering continues smoothly without blocking the main thread or dropping frames

5. **Given** the game is running at 60 FPS with WebGPU, **When** performance metrics are displayed, **Then** GPU draw calls are minimized (<100 per frame), vertex buffers are efficiently batched, and GPU memory usage is optimized

### Edge Cases
- What happens when WebGPU initialization fails after successful capability detection?
  ‚Üí System must immediately fall back to WebGL without crashing or losing game state

- How does system handle browsers with partial WebGPU support?
  ‚Üí System detects specific WebGPU features required and falls back gracefully if missing

- What happens when GPU memory is exhausted with 1000+ chunks loaded?
  ‚Üí System implements frustum culling and chunk unloading to stay within memory limits

- How does rendering perform on integrated GPUs vs dedicated GPUs?
  ‚Üí System adapts quality settings based on GPU tier detection (high/medium/low)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect WebGPU capability on browser startup and select appropriate rendering backend (WebGPU if available, WebGL otherwise)

- **FR-002**: System MUST render VoxelCraft terrain at 60 FPS when using WebGPU on capable hardware (constitutional target)

- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain minimum 30 FPS when using WebGL fallback (constitutional requirement)

- **FR-004**: System MUST fully utilize GPU hardware by implementing efficient vertex buffer management, indexed drawing, and minimal draw calls

- **FR-005**: System MUST batch chunk meshes to minimize draw calls (<100 per frame for 81 chunks)

- **FR-006**: System MUST implement vertex array objects (VAO) or equivalent to cache vertex attribute state

- **FR-007**: System MUST asynchronously generate and upload mesh data without blocking the render loop

- **FR-008**: System MUST implement frustum culling to render only visible chunks

- **FR-009**: System MUST log backend selection, initialization time, and performance metrics for debugging

- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle WebGPU initialization failures and fall back to WebGL without data loss

- **FR-011**: System MUST validate rendering consistency between WebGPU and WebGL backends (same visual output)

- **FR-012**: System MUST report GPU utilization metrics (draw calls, triangle count, buffer usage) to performance HUD

- **FR-013**: System MUST support dynamic mesh updates (block breaking/placing) without rebuilding entire scene buffers

- **FR-014**: System MUST implement proper GPU resource cleanup when disposing chunks to prevent memory leaks

- **FR-015**: System MUST initialize renderer within 2000ms budget (constitutional requirement)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **RenderBackend**: Represents the selected GPU API (WebGPU or WebGL), tracks initialization state, feature support, and performance metrics

- **VertexBuffer**: GPU memory buffer containing vertex data (position, normal, UV, color) for chunk meshes, managed with efficient upload/update strategies

- **IndexBuffer**: GPU memory buffer containing triangle indices for indexed drawing, reduces vertex duplication

- **RenderPipeline**: WebGPU render pipeline or WebGL program state encapsulating shaders, vertex layout, and render state

- **DrawCall**: Represents a single GPU draw command, batched to minimize state changes and maximize GPU utilization

- **PerformanceMetrics**: Tracks frame time, draw call count, triangle count, GPU memory usage, and backend type for debugging and HUD display
