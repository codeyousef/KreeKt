# Feature Specification: Fully Functional WebGPU/Vulkan Backend

**Feature Branch**: `015-add-fully-functional`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create the spec to have a fully functional webgpu/vulkan backend which apparently is missing from the project"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Platform integrator selects KreeKt target platform(s) for their 3D experience.
2. Build and packaging pipeline bundles the appropriate rendering backend assets for each target.
3. At application startup, the runtime detects GPU capabilities and negotiates access to WebGPU or Vulkan.
4. The renderer initializes swap chains/render surfaces, shader resources, and pipeline state for the chosen backend.
5. Scene graph, materials, lighting, animation, and post-processing features execute using unified APIs over the active backend.
6. The engine streams assets, manages GPU memory, and synchronizes CPU/GPU workloads while monitoring performance budgets.
7. Telemetry, validation layers, and health signals capture backend readiness, device loss, and feature coverage.
8. If backend negotiation fails, the application surfaces actionable guidance or configured fallback paths.
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Align WebGPU and Vulkan behavior so developers can ship the same scene code without backend-specific tweaks.
- Target delivery for the upcoming public beta release to unblock marketing commitments.
- Ensure Android and iOS shipping builds are ready for the same beta milestone with matching backend capabilities.
- Provide clear fallback and messaging paths for devices lacking required GPU capabilities.
- Maintain predictable performance targets across reference scenes and document any platform-specific limits.
- Keep configuration minimal: sane defaults with optional overrides for advanced teams.
- Ensure the backend work unlocks KreeKt flagship demos and validation suites without manual patches.

## Clarifications

No outstanding clarification markers.

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When neither WebGPU nor Vulkan can initialize, what fallback path should KreeKt apply by default? → A: Fail fast with a clear error
- Q: Which hardware tier should we treat as the reference baseline for backend performance targets? → A: Integrated GPUs (Apple M1 / Intel Iris Xe)
- Q: Which milestone should deliver the production-ready WebGPU/Vulkan backend? → A: Upcoming public beta release
- Q: Which advanced GPU capabilities must reach parity in this release? → A: Compute, ray tracing, and XR surfaces
- Q: Which telemetry signals must be captured when backend access is denied? → A: Backend name, error code, device/driver/OS info, feature flags, anonymized session ID, call stack
- Q: Do Android/iOS targets need day-one support with this backend effort? → A: Yes, launch both with the beta

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A cross-platform graphics developer builds a real-time 3D configurator with KreeKt. They ship the same Kotlin codebase to
web browsers and desktop apps. On the web, the experience boots into WebGPU for high fidelity rendering; on desktop,
the Vulkan backend unlocks advanced materials and post-processing. The developer expects identical visual results,
consistent performance targets, and helpful diagnostics if a user’s hardware cannot run the preferred backend.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a WebGPU-capable browser, **When** the developer loads the sample scene, **Then** the engine initializes the
   WebGPU backend automatically and renders the scene at the documented quality targets.
2. **Given** a desktop application on a Vulkan-capable device, **When** the user launches the app, **Then** the Vulkan
   backend is selected, all core renderer features are available, and no backend-specific code changes are required.
3. **Given** a user device that lacks required GPU features, **When** the application starts, **Then** the system informs
   the user or developer of the missing capability and applies the configured fallback or exit path.
4. **Given** a regression test suite covering lighting, shadows, animation, and post-processing, **When** it runs against
   both backends, **Then** the captured outputs remain within agreed visual and performance tolerances.
5. **Given** the developer queries runtime diagnostics, **When** they inspect backend status, **Then** they see backend
   name, feature flags, and any degraded capabilities exposed through a unified API.

### Edge Cases

- How does the system behave when GPU device creation fails mid-session (device lost, driver reset)?
- What happens when multiple windows or canvases request different backends simultaneously?
- How is memory pressure handled when GPU allocation requests exceed available budget?
- What happens on headless or CI environments without GPU access?
- How does the runtime respond when shader compilation fails on one backend but succeeds on the other?
- What occurs if security policies restrict access to modern graphics APIs in managed enterprise environments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Rendering Backend Availability**

- **FR-001**: System MUST expose a production-ready WebGPU backend for JavaScript targets covering all KreeKt flagship
  features (scene graph, PBR materials, lighting, animation, post-processing).
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose a production-ready Vulkan backend for JVM and native targets with equivalent feature
  coverage to the WebGPU backend.
- **FR-002a**: System MUST ship Android and iOS builds with full backend parity in the same public beta milestone, matching desktop/web capabilities.
- **FR-003**: System MUST auto-select the appropriate backend based on runtime capability detection while allowing
  developers to override selection via configuration.

**Feature Parity & Consistency**

- **FR-004**: System MUST deliver visually consistent results (color, lighting, shadow fidelity) across WebGPU and Vulkan
  within documented tolerance thresholds.
- **FR-004a**: System MUST provide feature parity for compute pipelines, ray tracing, and XR surface integration across both backends in this release.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure material, geometry, animation, and post-processing APIs behave identically regardless of
  backend.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a parity matrix documenting any intentional feature gaps between backends and the
  mitigation strategy for each gap.

**Fallbacks & Error Handling**

- **FR-007**: System MUST surface actionable error messaging when backend initialization fails, including capability
  checks and recommended remediation steps.
- **FR-008**: System MUST fail fast with a clear, actionable error when neither backend can initialize, including remediation guidance for developers and end users.
- **FR-009**: System MUST capture device-loss events and recover or exit gracefully without leaving the application in an
  undefined state.

**Performance & Reliability**

- **FR-010**: System MUST meet a target of 60 FPS (30 FPS minimum) on reference scenes for both backends when running on integrated GPUs comparable to Apple M1 or Intel Iris Xe with up-to-date drivers.
- **FR-011**: System MUST initialize rendering within 3 seconds on supported hardware for sample applications.
- **FR-012**: System MUST manage GPU memory allocations to prevent leaks across backend switches and long-running
  sessions.

**Developer Experience & Tooling**

- **FR-013**: System MUST offer a unified configuration API to query and set backend preferences at build and runtime.
- **FR-014**: System MUST expose runtime diagnostics (backend name, feature flags, performance metrics) accessible from
  Kotlin Multiplatform code.
- **FR-015**: System MUST ship updated documentation and samples demonstrating backend setup, troubleshooting, and
  best-practice guidance.

**Validation & Compliance**

- **FR-016**: System MUST include automated regression suites that compare outputs between WebGPU and Vulkan for core
  rendering scenarios.
- **FR-017**: System MUST log comprehensive telemetry when backend access is denied, including backend name, error code, device vendor/ID, driver version, OS build, detected feature flags, anonymized session identifier, and call stack, retained per security policy and surfaced to compliance reviewers.
- **FR-018**: System MUST document platform prerequisites, licensing considerations, and any third-party dependencies
  introduced by the backend work.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
