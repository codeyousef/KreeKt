## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

  health/hunger, flight enabled)
- Q: Which platforms should the basic version support? → A: JavaScript only (web browser)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A player enters a procedurally generated voxel world where they can freely explore a 3D environment made of different
block types (grass, dirt, stone, wood, etc.). The player can move around using standard first-person controls, look in
any direction, break blocks by clicking on them, and place blocks from their inventory. The world feels infinite as the
player explores, with terrain generating as they move into new areas. The player can modify the landscape creatively or
dig underground to discover resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new game is started, **When** the player spawns, **Then** they appear in a generated world standing on
   solid ground with blocks visible around them

2. **Given** the player is in the world, **When** they use movement controls (WASD), **Then** their character moves in
   the corresponding direction and the camera follows

3. **Given** the player is looking at a block, **When** they perform the break action (left click), **Then** the block
   disappears from the world and appears in their inventory

4. **Given** the player has blocks in their inventory, **When** they aim at a surface and perform the place action (
   right click), **Then** a new block appears adjacent to the target surface

5. **Given** the player is within the world boundaries, **When** they explore different areas, **Then** they see the
   fully generated world

6. **Given** the player is moving through the world, **When** they encounter different terrain types, **Then** they see
   varied landscapes (hills, valleys, caves, trees)

7. **Given** the player is looking around, **When** they move their mouse/touch input, **Then** the camera rotates
   smoothly to show different viewing angles

8. **Given** the player walks off a high ledge, **When** they fall, **Then** gravity affects them and they land on the
   ground below without taking damage (creative mode)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the player tries to break bedrock or unbreakable
  blocks? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there unbreakable blocks?]
- How does the system handle when the player tries to place a block inside another block or their own position?
- What happens when the player falls below Y=0 (bottom of world)?
- How does the system perform when many blocks are broken/placed rapidly?
- What happens when the player attempts to move beyond the 512x512 horizontal boundaries?
- What happens when the player attempts to place blocks above Y=255 (top of world)?
- How does the system handle when localStorage is full or unavailable?
- What happens when the player clears browser data while a world is loaded?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **World**: Represents the entire voxel game world, composed of chunks. Contains terrain generation rules, global
  properties (seed, time of day), and manages chunk loading/unloading.

- **Chunk**: A subdivision of the world representing a 16x16x256 section of blocks. The 512x512x256 world contains 32x32
  chunks (1,024 total chunks). Contains block data for its region, manages mesh generation for rendering, and handles
  updates when blocks change.

- **Block**: Represents a single voxel unit with a type (grass, stone, wood, etc.), visual appearance, and properties (
  solid/non-solid, break time, transparency). Blocks at specific coordinates define the world's structure.

- **Player**: Represents the user-controlled character with position, orientation, movement state (walking, jumping,
  falling), inventory contents, and interaction capabilities (break/place range, selected block).

- **BlockType**: Defines the characteristics of each block variety including visual textures, hardness, tool
  requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: tool system included?], and behavior properties.

- **Inventory**: Collection of block types and quantities owned by the player, with methods to add/remove blocks and
  select active block type.

- **Camera**: First-person viewpoint attached to player position, with orientation controlled by input, and rendering
  frustum for determining visible chunks.

areas needing clarification:

1. **Scope Definition**: Which Minecraft features define "basic"?
2. **Platform Support**: Which KreeKt platforms to target?
3. **Persistence**: Save/load functionality requirements
4. **Game Modes**: Creative only, survival, or both?
5. **Performance Targets**: Frame rate and world size goals
6. **UI/UX Details**: Inventory display, HUD elements
7. **Advanced Features**: Which features to exclude from v1?

Once clarified, the specification will be ready for the planning phase.
