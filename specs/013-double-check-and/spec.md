**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "double check and make sure we have all the features of threejs from
@docs/private/features.md, if not create a spec to implement anything we're missing. obviously adapt it to our project
like we're not using opengl we're using webgpu"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Request: Verify complete Three.js r180 feature parity

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A developer working with Three.js r180 wants to migrate their 3D web application to KreeKt for Kotlin Multiplatform
support. They need to find equivalent functionality for every Three.js feature they currently use, including renderers,
post-processing effects, advanced loaders, exporters, and utility systems. The migration should be straightforward with
minimal surprises.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Three.js project using SVGRenderer, **When** migrating to KreeKt, **Then** the developer finds an
   equivalent SVG rendering capability
2. **Given** a Three.js project using EffectComposer with multiple post-processing passes, **When** migrating to KreeKt,
   **Then** the developer finds a complete post-processing pipeline system
3. **Given** a Three.js project loading various model formats (FBX, COLLADA, STL, PLY, etc.), **When** migrating to
   KreeKt, **Then** the developer finds dedicated loader classes for each format
4. **Given** a Three.js project exporting scenes to GLTF/USDZ, **When** migrating to KreeKt, **Then** the developer
   finds equivalent export functionality
5. **Given** a Three.js project using various geometry utilities (convex hull, tessellation, simplification), **When**
   migrating to KreeKt, **Then** the developer finds equivalent geometry processing tools
6. **Given** a Three.js project using node-based materials (TSL), **When** the WebGPU backend is available, **Then** the
   developer can use node-based material composition
7. **Given** a Three.js project with performance monitoring (Stats.js), **When** migrating to KreeKt, **Then** the
   developer finds integrated performance monitoring
8. **Given** a Three.js project using specific helpers (VertexNormalsHelper, VertexTangentsHelper, etc.), **When**
   migrating to KreeKt, **Then** the developer finds all visualization helpers

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer needs a specific compressed texture format (ASTC, ETC2, BC) that's platform-dependent?
- How does the system handle feature detection when certain post-processing effects require specific GPU capabilities?
- What happens when loading a model format that has platform-specific dependencies?
- How does the system gracefully degrade when WebGPU features aren't available on a platform?
