- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific graphics APIs, internal architecture)
- üë• Written for library users who need Three.js feature parity

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a 3D graphics developer migrating from Three.js to KreeKt, I need every Three.js r180 feature available in KreeKt so that I can port my existing Three.js applications to Kotlin Multiplatform without losing functionality or having to rewrite significant portions of my codebase.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Three.js r180 feature reference, **When** I search for the equivalent in KreeKt, **Then** I find a matching API with equivalent capabilities
2. **Given** a Three.js code sample using any r180 feature, **When** I translate it to KreeKt, **Then** all APIs exist and produce equivalent visual results
3. **Given** the complete Three.js feature list, **When** I audit KreeKt's implementation, **Then** 100% of features have corresponding implementations
4. **Given** advanced Three.js features (post-processing, WebXR, complex animations), **When** I use them in KreeKt, **Then** they work across all supported platforms (JVM, JS, Native)
5. **Given** Three.js helper utilities and debugging tools, **When** I develop with KreeKt, **Then** I have equivalent developer experience

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Three.js feature is WebGL-specific but KreeKt uses Vulkan/Metal/WebGPU?
  ‚Üí Adapt feature to multiplatform graphics abstraction layer
- How does system handle Three.js features that rely on browser APIs?
  ‚Üí Provide platform-appropriate alternatives or clearly mark as web-only
- What about Three.js addon libraries (physics engines, controls)?
  ‚Üí Include equivalent functionality in core or provide integration points
- How to handle Three.js features marked experimental or deprecated in r180?
  ‚Üí Document compatibility status, implement stable features first

## Notes

This specification captures the complete Three.js r180 API surface as documented in `docs/private/features.md`, adapted for Kotlin Multiplatform implementation. The specification intentionally avoids prescribing specific graphics API implementations (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU), deferring those decisions to the planning phase while ensuring all user-facing Three.js capabilities are preserved.

The requirements are organized by major Three.js subsystems for clarity and traceability. Each requirement is testable by comparing KreeKt's API against the corresponding Three.js r180 documentation and examples.
