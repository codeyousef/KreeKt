- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a game developer using KreeKt**, I want to deploy VoxelCraft as a fully functional 3D voxel game using modern
graphics APIs (WebGPU on web, Vulkan on desktop), so that end users experience smooth 60 FPS gameplay with visually
consistent rendering across all platforms.

**As an end user playing VoxelCraft**, I want to see beautifully rendered voxel terrain that loads quickly and runs
smoothly, so that I can build and explore my voxel world without performance issues or visual glitches.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: VoxelCraft Launches Successfully on Web**

1. **Given** a user opens VoxelCraft in a modern web browser (Chrome 113+)
2. **When** the game initializes
3. **Then** the renderer detects WebGPU support, initializes successfully, and displays the voxel terrain within 2
   seconds
4. **And** the game maintains 60 FPS during camera movement and terrain interaction

**Scenario 2: VoxelCraft Launches Successfully on Desktop (JVM)**

1. **Given** a user launches VoxelCraft desktop application on a system with Vulkan support
2. **When** the game initializes
3. **Then** the renderer detects Vulkan, initializes successfully, and displays the voxel terrain within 2 seconds
4. **And** the game maintains 60 FPS during camera movement and terrain interaction

**Scenario 3: WebGL Fallback Works Seamlessly**

1. **Given** a user opens VoxelCraft in a browser without WebGPU support
2. **When** the game initializes
3. **Then** the renderer automatically falls back to WebGL, displays a notice to the user, and still renders the terrain
   correctly
4. **And** the game maintains at least 30 FPS (minimum acceptable performance)

**Scenario 4: Terrain Rendering is Visually Consistent**

1. **Given** VoxelCraft is running on both web (WebGPU) and desktop (Vulkan)
2. **When** the same seed generates terrain in both versions
3. **Then** the visual output is 95%+ identical (measured via SSIM structural similarity)
4. **And** colors, lighting, and chunk boundaries match exactly

**Scenario 5: User Interacts with Rendered World**

1. **Given** VoxelCraft is running with terrain fully loaded
2. **When** the user moves the camera, breaks blocks, or places blocks
3. **Then** all changes render immediately without visual artifacts or lag
4. **And** frame rate remains stable (no stuttering or frame drops below 30 FPS)

**Scenario 6: Large Terrain Renders Efficiently**

1. **Given** VoxelCraft generates a 512√ó512√ó256 block world (1,024 chunks)
2. **When** the user explores the world
3. **Then** visible chunks render within view frustum
4. **And** memory usage stays under 500MB
5. **And** frame rate maintains 60 FPS target

### Edge Cases

  to GPU memory and bound during render pass execution.

- **Index Buffer**: Contains triangle indices (u16 or u32) for indexed rendering. Reduces memory usage by reusing
  vertices.

- **Uniform Buffer**: Contains transformation matrices (model, view, projection as mat4x4<f32>). Updated per frame or
  per object. Bound to shader pipeline.

- **Render Pass**: Describes framebuffer clearing (background color) and drawing operations. Executes commands on GPU to
  render geometry.

- **Swapchain**: Manages presentable images for displaying rendered frames. Handles double/triple buffering and vsync.

**Rendering Pipeline Entities:**

- **Shader Module**: Compiled shader code (WGSL for WebGPU, SPIR-V for Vulkan). Contains vertex and fragment shader
  entry points.

- **Pipeline Layout**: Describes shader resource bindings (uniform buffers, textures). Defines how data flows from CPU
  to GPU.

- **Render Pipeline**: Complete graphics pipeline state (shaders, vertex layout, primitive topology, blending, depth
  testing). Configured once, used for all draw calls.

**VoxelCraft Game Entities:**

- **Chunk Mesh**: Generated mesh data for a 16√ó16√ó256 voxel chunk. Contains vertex buffer, index buffer, and triangle
  count. Generated via greedy meshing algorithm.

- **Voxel World**: Collection of chunks representing 512√ó512√ó256 block world. Manages chunk loading, mesh generation,
  and rendering.

- **Camera**: First-person perspective camera with position, rotation, and projection matrix. Generates view and
  projection matrices for rendering.

**Performance Tracking Entities:**

- **Render Statistics**: Tracks FPS (frames per second), frame time (milliseconds), triangle count, draw calls, texture
  memory, buffer memory. Updated every frame.

- **Performance Metrics**: Historical performance data for trend analysis. Used to validate 60 FPS target and 30 FPS
  minimum.

  PerformanceBenchmarkTest.kt) from Feature 019

### Assumptions

- Target hardware has modern GPU (supports Vulkan 1.1+ on JVM, WebGPU or WebGL2 on JS)
- Target browsers for WebGPU: Chrome 113+, Edge 113+ (others fall back to WebGL2)
- Constitutional performance requirements remain: 60 FPS target, 30 FPS minimum (from KreeKt constitution)
- Visual parity threshold remains: 95%+ SSIM similarity across backends (from Feature 019 FR-020)
- VoxelCraft game logic remains unchanged (no new features like lighting, multiplayer, physics)

### Out of Scope

- Advanced lighting (deferred to Phase 2-13 per Feature 019 spec)
- Transparency/alpha blending (deferred to Phase 2-13 per Feature 019 spec)
- Post-processing effects (bloom, tone mapping, etc.)
- Texture mapping (VoxelCraft uses solid colors only)
- Skeletal animation or skinned meshes
- Physics engine integration beyond existing collision detection
- Multiplayer networking
- Mobile platform support (Android/iOS deferred to future features)
