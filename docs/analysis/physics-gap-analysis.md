# Physics Subsystem Gap Analysis

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-01
**Target**: Three.js r180 API Compatibility

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: ðŸ”´ Major Gap - Physics integration not implemented
**Estimated Completion**: 10 days (80 hours)

## Missing Core Components (Contract Requirements)

**From contracts/physics-api.kt**:
- PhysicsWorld (integration with Rapier)
- RigidBody
- Collider shapes (Box, Sphere, Capsule, Mesh, etc.)
- Constraints (joints, motors)
- Character controller

**Missing Physics Features**:
- Collision detection and response
- Raycasting
- Trigger volumes
- Forces and impulses
- Physics material properties (friction, restitution)
- Continuous collision detection (CCD)

**Integration Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Rapier physics engine (Rust WASM for Web, native for other platforms)
- **Fallback**: Bullet physics (C++ native bindings)
- Platform-specific expect/actual for physics backend
