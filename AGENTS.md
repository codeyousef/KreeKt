# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Core multiplatform code lives under `src/commonMain`, with platform-specific `actual` implementations in `src/jvmMain`, `src/jsMain`, and `src/nativeMain`. Feature modules such as `kreekt-loader`, `kreekt-helpers`, and `kreekt-validation` encapsulate loaders, utilities, and the validation CLI. Examples for demos reside in `examples/*`, reference docs in `docs/`, and audit specifications under `specs/`. System tests live in `ests/` split into contract, integration, performance, and visual suites; mirror that layout when adding coverage.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `./gradlew build` before pushes to compile all targets and execute default checks. Use `./gradlew test` for the multiplatform unit suites or scope with module selectors, e.g., `./gradlew :kreekt-validation:test`. Generate coverage with `./gradlew koverVerify`; inspect HTML reports via `./gradlew koverHtmlReport` and open `build/reports/kover/html/index.html`. List runnable demos using `./gradlew listExamples`, launch the baseline scene with `./gradlew :examples:basic-scene:runJvm`, and produce API docs via `./gradlew dokkaHtml`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow official Kotlin style with four-space indentation, trailing commas where they clarify diffs, and explicit visibility. Public types use UpperCamelCase, members lowerCamelCase, Gradle tasks lowerCamelCase, and module directories hyphenated. Avoid `!!` and unchecked casts. Run the IDE formatter or ktlint; CI expects reports under `build/reports/ktlint/`.

## Testing Guidelines
Author unit tests in `src/*Test` using `kotlin.test`; JVM-specific cases can leverage JUnit 5 and MockK. Place integration and performance scenarios in `ests/integration` with descriptive `*Test.kt` filenames. Maintain at least 50% coverage via Kover while working toward the 95% target.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commits with short imperative subjects (e.g., "Add validation wiring"). PRs should summarize scope, enumerate validation steps (`./gradlew build`, key demos), and link relevant roadmap items or issues. Attach coverage artifacts for core logic and screenshots for visual work, and request CI validation for cross-platform changes.

## Security & Compliance Checks
Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` during security reviews. Validate release readiness through `./gradlew validateProductionReadiness`, reviewing reports in `kreekt-validation/build/validation-reports/`.
